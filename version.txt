Solonelys Reasoning
---------------------------------------------
Well, I initially was writing this for a 
class I had in Software Process. However
afterwards I slowly started adding more and
more features and found that I got addicted
and found really amusing generating lots of 
random information.

This was initially meant to be a quick 
script to solve a specific problem, so there
will be rewrites.

In the future I wish for this script to be
versatile enough so that other people who
wish to use it in order to poppulate 
databases do not have the same trouble as I
have
=============================================

  o RandomEngine needs to be tested
