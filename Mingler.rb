# The strict purpose of this class is to read different output files with delimited information
# and generate other such files. 
# The user is expected to handle much of this on his or her own.
#
# Format should be something like filename1:1,2 filename2:9,3,2 
# so the mingler simply needs to visit the files and get the required columns
# and finally generate an output file as well.
